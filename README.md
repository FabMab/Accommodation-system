Accommodation system for university project

### Brief description
Requirement for project is to design and implement a system which enables the hall manager and wardens to shedule hall activities and keep track of the hall rooms for a student hall of residence. Rental agreements between a student and the accomodation office are uniquely identified using a lease number. The data stored on each lease includes a lease number, duration of lease, halls details, room number and students name. The hall manager generates and maintains rooms schedules, keep a record of all the student staying in the halls and can edit and view room details. A warden has limited editing privileges and can only change a room's cleaning status.
